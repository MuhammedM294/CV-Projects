# Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains a collection of computer vision projects implemented in Python. These projects are designed to practice and refresh my understanding of computer vision concepts and techniques.

## Projects List

### 1. [Color Detection with OpenCV using the HSV Color Space](https://github.com/MuhammedM294/cv-projects/tree/main/ColorDetection)
This project demonstrates how to detect a specific color in a video stream using OpenCV. The detection is performed in the HSV color space, which is more robust for color detection tasks compared to the RGB color space.
